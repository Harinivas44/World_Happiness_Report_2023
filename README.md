# World Happiness Report 2023 (Statistical Analysis) 🌍😃

# Overview

Welcome to the World Happiness Report 2023 (Statistical Analysis) project! This project aims to analyze and uncover insights from the World Happiness Report data for the year 2023. The World Happiness Report measures various factors that contribute to the happiness and well-being of people in different countries. Using statistical methods, we delve into this data to better understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on happiness.
## 📋 Data Exploration

The project begins by importing and exploring the dataset, which contains information about various countries, including their happiness rankings and several key attributes such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and more.

Basic data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics:

* The dataset contains information on 137 countries.
* It includes numerical attributes like average life evaluation, GDP per capita, social support, and more.
* Missing values are checked, and columns are renamed for clarity.

## Data Visualization 📊📈

The data is visualized to gain insights and understand its distribution:

* Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of key attributes like average life evaluation, GDP per capita, and others.
* Box plots are created to identify outliers in some of these attributes.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlations between different attributes are explored to understand their relationships:

* The correlation matrix is calculated and visualized using a heatmap.
* Strong correlations are observed between attributes like GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy, as well as social support and freedom to make life choices.

## Hypothesis Testing 📊🧪

Hypothesis tests are conducted to determine significant relationships between key attributes and average life evaluation:

* T-tests 🧪 are performed to investigate relationships between average life evaluation and attributes like healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, GDP per capita, and perceptions of corruption.
* ANOVA tests 🧪 are used to assess relationships between average life evaluation and multiple attributes, including generosity, social support, and dystopia + residual, simultaneously.
* Similar tests are performed for healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and generosity.


## Conclusion 🎉🔍

This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing happiness levels in different countries. The analysis helps us understand the relationships between various attributes and average life evaluation, contributing to a deeper understanding of global happiness trends.
